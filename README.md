\# Java Design Patterns — Simplified Notes \& Examples



\## 💡 Purpose

This repository is created to document my learning journey of \*\*Design Patterns in Java\*\*.  

My goal is to write \*\*clean, easy-to-understand examples\*\* of each pattern and add \*\*simple notes\*\* explaining the logic behind them.



---



\## 🎯 Goal

\- Understand the concept and purpose of each design pattern.

\- Write short, practical Java implementations.

\- Create a personal reference that’s also helpful for others learning the same topic.

\- Keep things minimal — focus on clarity, not complexity.



---



\## 🤝 How It Helps Others

If you're learning design patterns, this repo can:

\- Help you \*\*grasp the core idea quickly\*\* through simplified Java examples.

\- Serve as a \*\*ready reference\*\* for revising important concepts before interviews or exams.

\- Provide \*\*well-commented code snippets\*\* instead of long theoretical explanations.



---



\## 🧱 Structure

The repository is organized into three main sections:

\- \*\*Creational Patterns\*\*

\- \*\*Structural Patterns\*\*

\- \*\*Behavioral Patterns\*\*



Each folder will contain:

\- Example Java files for the pattern.

\- A short note or explanation of when and why to use it.
